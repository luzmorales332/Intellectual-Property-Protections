   China's copyright laws are good since they are like the United States but they do not really enforce them against their people when they break them. For example, Shenzhen from Beijing Publisher and Co had copied 650,000 Microsoft Corporation holograms and were forced to paid only 252 American dollars. The losses to microsoft were around $30 million and Shenzhen paid only about one tenth of the damages. Their cpyright laws should be enforced on their people so things like this do not happen again.
